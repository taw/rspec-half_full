# rspec-half_full

There are no failed specs, only specs with unexpected outcomes.

If you subscribe to the view that tests are half-passing not half-failing, this gem might be for you!

## How to use

Run `rspec` like this:

    rspec --color --require rspec/half_full --format RSpec::HalfFull

Or copy over `.rspec` file into your project.
